sandbox challenge 2024

## How to run your solution
Run node app.js in the terminal

##Your thought process/how you designed your solution
I started off using the sample data given and writing a function to get the participant's name and id. From there I attempted to replace the sample data with a get request. At first I didn't use async/await to do this and I found that when I tried to use the data it would sometimes return as undefined. After looking into this error I discovered async/await functions can be used to wait until the data has been returned from the API.
